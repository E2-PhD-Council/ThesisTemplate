# Thesis template
Thesis template(s) for Chalmers E2 PhD students

Contact: [phd-council.e2@chalmers.se](mailto:phd-council.e2@chalmers.se)

## Disclaimer

The intention of the template is to provide an open-source basis for Chalmers PhD students to collaborate on the mundande task of structuring a thesis.
We strive for compliance with Chalmers official guide lines, but this is not an official Chalmers document and we give no guarantees of compliance.

The guidelines are available here:

- [Licentiate guidelines](https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/licentiate/layout-and-printing-of-licentiate-thesis/)
- [PhD thesis guidelines](https://intranet.chalmers.se/en/tools-support/doctoral-studies-support/doctoral-thesis-defence/thesis-layout/)

They are currently under revision but will be posted in full here.
Our ambition is to stay up to speed with them but if you see any discrepancies please let us know, see [below](#Contribute).


## Current status

The template has been released to the public but it is in a beta-phase and needs to be tested thoroughly.
Found a problem or bug? See [below](#Contribute)

## Usage

### Get the template

1. Using git

You can either _fork_ this repository to your own github account, see [this guide](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo),
or you can _clone_ it to a local computer. The command

```bash
git clone git@github.com:E2-PhD-Council/ThesisTemplate.git ThesisTemplate
```
will create a local copy of the template repository in `<current-directory>/ThesisTemplate`.

2. Just getting the files

In the [releases](https://github.com/E2-PhD-Council/ThesisTemplate/releases) tab, you can access all released versions of the template.

### Using the template in Overleaf

The template in the Overleaf templates gallery if currently out of date and does not match the template here on GitHub. We are working on getting the Overleaf template updated. In the meantime, do the following to use this template in Overleaf:

i) Download the template as .zip according to the instructions above.

ii) On your Overleaf projects page select 'New project > Upload project'. Select or drag in the .zip containing the Thesis template.

iii) In your newly created project, go to 'Menu > Main document' and make sure the main document is set to `Thesis.tex`. If this setting is not set correct there may be issues compiling the project.

Now, the template is ready to be filled with your content.



### Template structure

The only files that should be changed are contained within the folder `YourThesis`.

When creating a new thesis, start with `YourThesis/Config.tex` to set up all the general information.

The main file of the thesis is `Thesis.tex`, which initiates the template files.
No changes should be made to this file, it is just for easy access.

### Mock-up cover

The print service will scrape info like name, title etc. and produce a new cover.
The template will still generate a mock-up of the cover for you to get a notion of the layout, but note that this is will not be used in the print.

### Title page

This actual page will be used by the print service. We are trying to have them generate this title page as well but until then you need to make sure to replace the watermarked logo yourself.
Logotypes are found [here](https://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/profile-and-identity/Pages/logotype.aspx)


## Versioning

We will strive to follow a [semver](https://semver.org/)
policy by changing major versions whenever breaking changes occur.

However, as long as we are in a 0.x.y version this is not guaranteed.
